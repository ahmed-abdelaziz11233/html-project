  <tr>
    <td>A computer program without AI can answer the specific questions it is meant to solve.</td>
    <td>A computer program with AI can answer the generic questions it is meant to solve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Modification in the program leads to change in its structure.</td>
    <td>AI programs can absorb new modifications by putting highly independent pieces of information together. Hence you can modify even a minute piece of information of program without affecting its structure.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>Modification is not quick and easy. It may lead to affecting the program adversely.</td>
  <td>Quick and Easy program modification.</td>
